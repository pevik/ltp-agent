# LTP Agent

AI agent configuration for test design, reviewing, converting, and testing
[Linux Test Project](https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp) patches.

Supported AI coding agents:

- [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)
- [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi)
- [OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode)
- [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)
- [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository and install the skills for your agent:

   ```sh
   git clone <this-repo-url> ltp-agent
   ./ltp-agent/setup.sh <agent>
   ```

   `<agent>` is one of: `claude`, `pi`, `opencode`, `gemini`, `copilot`.
   The skills are copied into the agent's native skill directory. For
   `opencode`, the multi-agent conversion pipeline is also installed into
   `~/.config/opencode/agent/`. The LTP source tree is not touched.

2. Clone the LTP source tree:

   ```sh
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp.git
   ```

3. Start your AI coding agent from the LTP directory. The skills are
   discovered automatically from their installed location.

## Entry Point

The `ltp` skill is an automatic entry point. When you work inside an LTP
tree, it loads on its own and makes the agent aware that LTP-specific rules
apply to every code change, review, analysis, and commit message. It routes
the agent to the relevant rule files under `rules/` and to the specialized
skills (`ltp-review`, `ltp-analyze`, `ltp-teach`, `ltp-convert`). You do not
invoke it directly; it activates whenever the working directory looks like
an LTP tree.

## Usage

### Reviewing a Patch

With the patches applied into your development branch, invoke the review skill
inside your agent:

```
/ltp-review
```

This performs a deep code review against all LTP rules and writes the resulting
inline email reply to `review-inline.txt` at the LTP tree root.

### Analyzing a Test

To perform a deep, read-only analysis of an LTP test (quality, robustness,
and coverage):

```
/ltp-analyze <file path or test name>
```

The skill works on any LTP test (old API, new API, or shell). It produces a
report covering test intent, value, robustness, coverage gaps, API/style
compliance, and prioritized recommendations. No files are modified.

### Designing Tests for a Coding Model

Select a strong model in your client. From the LTP checkout, ask:

```text
Use ltp-teach to design tests for <feature or regression>.
```

Clients that expose skills as `/name` can use
`/ltp-teach <feature or regression>`.
Pi uses `/skill:ltp-teach <feature or regression>`.
The skill uses the current checkout and source locations from your session
instructions. It researches existing coverage and asks questions only when
missing facts block the design.

The skill returns an implementation brief in the conversation. The brief
includes source evidence, cases with stable IDs, expected results,
false-pass risks, file changes, and proposed verification commands. Its
status is `READY` or `BLOCKED`. The skill does not modify files, implement
tests, or execute commands that build or run tests.

Give a `READY` brief to the smaller coding model. The brief contains
instructions to preserve its cases and assertions and report actual
verification results. Select both models in your client. The skill does
not switch models or launch agents.
Use client permissions to enforce read-only access when needed.

For an existing installation, run `./setup.sh <agent>` again from this
repository. The installer overwrites installed skill copies and, for
OpenCode, agent definitions.
Quit and restart OpenCode after installation to load the new skill.

### Converting Old Tests to New API

To convert a test from the legacy `test.h` API to the modern `tst_test.h` API:

```
/ltp-convert
```

For every test the skill evaluates two conversion strategies (a semantic
rewrite using new-API idioms, or a faithful port that preserves the original
structure), chooses the best one, and presents a Conversion Plan that you must
confirm before any file is changed. The original test intent is never dropped.

> [!NOTE]
> Converted test is just a draft, most of the times the developer will need to
> update the test by hand.

To find candidates for conversion, scan the tree with:

```sh
python3 ltp-agent/tools/scan-old-api.py --root-dir <ltp directory>
```

#### Multi-agent conversion (opencode)

On opencode, an orchestrated multi-agent pipeline is also installed. Switch to
the `ltp-converter` primary agent and give it a test path or name. It delegates
to five subagents:

- `ltp-analyzer` builds a punctual Intent Contract and decides the strategy.
- `ltp-creator` implements the converted test, bound to that contract.
- `ltp-builder` compiles the converted test with the LTP build system and
  reports errors and warnings before review. It builds through the
  `tools/ltp-build.sh` helper, which builds both the 32-bit and (when the
  test directory defines one) the 64-bit large-file variant in a single
  invocation.
- `ltp-runner` (opt-in) runs the converted test in a sandbox and reports its
  outcome when the test is sandbox-runnable. It runs through the
  `tools/ltp-run.sh` helper.
- `ltp-reviewer` audits the result against the contract and LTP rules.

The orchestrator loops create/build/(run)/review until the intent is fully
preserved, and still stops for Conversion Plan approval before writing any
file.

##### Pinning models per agent

The pipeline ships with no `model:` pinning so it runs anywhere opencode does.
To pin a model per role, put an `agent` block in **your** opencode config
(global `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`/`.jsonc`, or per-project
`.opencode/opencode.json` in your LTP checkout). The keys are the agent file
basenames. Example:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "agent": {
    "ltp-converter": { "model": "<provider>/claude-sonnet-5" },
    "ltp-analyzer": { "model": "<provider>/claude-opus-4.8" },
    "ltp-creator": { "model": "<provider>/claude-opus-4.8" },
    "ltp-builder": { "model": "<provider>/claude-haiku-4-5@20251001" },
    "ltp-runner": { "model": "<provider>/claude-haiku-4-5@20251001" },
    "ltp-reviewer": { "model": "<provider>/claude-sonnet-5" },
  },
}
```

Replace `<provider>` with the provider key from your `provider` block (e.g.
`google-vertex`, `anthropic`, `opencode`). Anything you leave out falls back
to the primary agent's model (opencode default for subagents). This repo
intentionally does not ship model IDs.

## Rule Files

The `rules/` directory contains rule files that the agent loads on demand
based on the task:

| File                      | Description                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `ground-rules.md`         | Mandatory rules for all LTP code.            |
| `c-tests.md`              | Rules for LTP C tests.                       |
| `shell-tests.md`          | Rules for LTP shell tests.                   |
| `openposix.md`            | Rules for Open POSIX Test Suite.             |
| `classify.md`             | Classify rules for LTP files.                |
| `dispatch.md`             | Maps classifications to rule files.          |
| `commit-message.md`       | Rules for LTP commit messages.               |
| `build-system.md`         | Rules for LTP Makefiles and build system.    |
| `git.md`                  | Rules for LTP git configuration files.       |
| `documentation.md`        | Rules for LTP Sphinx docs and doc-comments.  |
| `false-positive-guide.md` | Verification checklist applied after review. |
| `email-template.md`       | Complete format of a review reply email.     |
| `conversion-strategy.md`  | Choosing an old-to-new API conversion path.  |

## Continuous Integration

The `.github/workflows/ci-copilot-review.yml` workflow runs `/ltp-review`
automatically against LTP Patchwork series using GitHub Copilot CLI, posts
the verdict back to Patchwork as a check, and (if SMTP credentials are
configured) sends the inline review to the mailing list as a reply to the
original submission. It is triggered manually by series ID via
`workflow_dispatch`.
